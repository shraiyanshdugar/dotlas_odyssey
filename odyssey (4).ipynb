        "> 📝 It's important to note that while this example is straightforward, you may encounter some ambiguity when working with the actual datasets Delta through Yankee. **The main objective is to construct a dataset that provides a comprehensive and detailed context for each restaurant**. There will be instances where you'll need to make subjective decisions, such as prioritizing one dataset over another or creating a new field to harmonize different representations of the same data across datasets (e.g., your own classification of price range). These decisions are up to you, and we encourage you to develop your own approach and rationale for resolving these issues. Just make sure to explain your choices and reasoning in a markdown cell.\n",

You may use [Great Expectations](https://greatexpectations.io/) or any other tool of your preference to run the tests and profile the data.\n",

        "\n",
        "- **Test Design**: Outline the data quality tests you plan to run. Explain why you have chosen these tests and what potential issues they could uncover.\n",
        "- **Test Execution**: Execute the designed tests on the dataframe. Document the results of each test, including any discrepancies or anomalies identified.\n",
        "- **Data Profiling**: Perform a thorough profiling of the data to understand its characteristics and quality. This may include understanding the distribution of different features, identifying outliers, or assessing the completeness and uniqueness of the data.\n",
        "- **Edge Case Identification**: Discuss any edge cases you have identified during the testing and profiling process. Explain how these edge cases could affect the downstream use of the dataset and propose potential solutions to address them.\n",
